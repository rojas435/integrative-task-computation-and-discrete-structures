Repository for the integrative task

The objective of this project is to develop a system that allows improving the process of entry and exit of passengers on an airline flight. To do this, a database with passenger information must be simulated, allowing the registration of their arrival at the boarding gate and showing the order in which they must enter the plane, taking into account the order of arrival and prioritizing first class accordingly. to certain additional criteria. In addition, an order of departure from the plane must be established taking into account its configuration, where the first to leave are those in the first rows and an established order is followed by proximity to the aisle or order of arrival. Efficiency and speed are key factors in the implementation of the system, since it is expected to handle large amounts of data.
